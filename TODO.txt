TODO:
- Warp Batch Script exporter, test it on Windows too.
- DistoIma Batch Script exporter, must be well tested.
- Research the "Lens Centre" feature in 3DE and MatchMover, in terms of distortion and Maya export - does MatchMover adjust the filmback offset like 3DE?.
  - Answer: MM will not modify the filmback offset, but will change the distortion centre, this has been changed in this tool.
- Testing files should automatically run images through Warp4 and DistoIma, then check the two images against each other (using OpenImageIO, idiff or oiiotool) - this should be part of the unit test suite.
- Create GUI for selecting which exports to do, and the options for the exporters.
  - "Fake" Multi-threading should be an option (on by default?).
  - When exporting files, there should be an option of where to export them to, (the same directory, custom directory).
  - When (un)distorting images, the user should be able to choose the output image format (it should default to JPEG).

Next Release:
- Tested Weta Nuke Distortion Node Export.
- Warp4 and DistoIma Batch Script Exporters.
- Well tested, +95% coverage!


Future Releases:
- 2.5D Point Export from MatchMover
- PFTrack distortion conversion.
  - This does not seem possible.
- Maya export from MM.
  - Should use ZXY rotation order.
  - Perhaps it should modify the filmback offset?
