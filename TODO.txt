TODO:
- Testing files should automatically run images through Warp4 and DistoIma, then check the two images against each other (using OpenImageIO, idiff or oiiotool) - this should be part of the unit test suite.
- Create GUI for selecting which exports to do, and the options for the exporters.
  - "Fake" Multi-threading should be an option (on by default?).
  - When exporting files, there should be an option of where to export them to, (the same directory, custom directory).
  - When (un)distorting images, the user should be able to choose the output image format (it should default to JPEG) as well as the output directory.

Next Release:
- Option Windows written for all exporters.
- A way to only export distortion for a limited frame range and camera, given an RZML file.
- Well tested, +95% coverage!

Future Releases:
- ST-Map Distortion Export (should probably use Nuke to do this).
- 2.5D Point Export from MatchMover
- Maya export from MM.
  - Should use ZXY rotation order.
  - Perhaps it should modify the filmback offset?
