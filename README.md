# Matchmover Distortion Tool
This project is a historical snapshot of a tool written in 2013, but never released. In time it may be updated and improved.

The primary use of this tool is to load an Autodesk RZML file and convert the data into modern-day formats.

This tool can convert Autodesk Matchmover lens distortion into:
- Nuke script with 3DEqualizer LDPK nodes (.nk)
- 3DEqualizer Lens format (.txt)
- 3DEqualizer Warp4 format
- Batch Script for 3DEqualizer Warp4 (.bat / .sh)
- Batch Script for RealViz DistoIma (.bat / .sh)

The only supported lens distortion output for the software other than this tool is to use [Shake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_(software)), which was discontinued by Apple in 2009.
